 HOW TO RUN TESTS:

I have given the tag   @P0_MostCriticalTestCases     for most critical test cases.

I have given the tag   @P1_ImportantTestCases      for important test cases.

I have given the tag   @P2_NotVeryCriticalTestCases    for not very critical test cases.

You can paste these tags inside the tags option of Runner class one by one and run the Runner to see the results.
